        <h1>Who is Elon musk?</h1>
        <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS  born June 28, 1971) is an entrepreneur and business magnate. 
            He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, 
            and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder
             of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the world
              as of September 2021.

            Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria,
             South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada 
             aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania
              two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics.
               He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided
               to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2
                with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million
                 in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged
                  with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 
                  2002 for $1.5 billion.
            
            In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport
             services company, of which he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric
              vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and
               product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity,
                a solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla
                
                Energy. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that 
                promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016, he co-founded Neuralink,
                 a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces,
                  and founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has 
                  proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed vactrain transportation system.
            
            Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances
             and highly publicized controversies. In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a 
             
             British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave rescue; a California jury ruled
              in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and Exchange
               Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private
                takeover of Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his
                 chairmanship and accepting limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread
                  misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has received criticism from
                   experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence,
                    cryptocurrency, and public transport.</p>
                    <h2>Who are Elon musk's parents?</h2>
                    <p>Philanthropist, and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk’s parents are Maye Musk
                        and Errol Musk. Maye Musk, also known as Maye Haldeman, is a model and dietitian, 
                        appearing on the cover of magazines such as Time and The New York Post.
                        
                        She was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada and has a twin sister, Kaye.

                        Elon Musk is currently dating Canadian singer/songwriter Grimes.                        
                        In 1950, the family moved to Pretoria, South Africa, 
                        where she was a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa. 
                        Errol Musk is also known as Errol Graham Musk and is a South                         
                        African electromechanical engineer, sailor, and pilot. He was
                         born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa.
                        
                        Maye Musk earned her master’s degree in dietetics from the 
                        University of the Orange Free State in South Africa, followed by 
                        another master’s degree in nutritional science from the University of Toronto.
                        
                        Errol Musk is renowned for the scandals surrounding him, making the 
                        headlines several times, including the revelation that he had sexual                         
                        relations with his stepdaughter, Jana Bezuidenhout, even having a baby
                         with her, claiming it was ‘God’s plan’.
                        
                        He and Elon have a strained relationship and haven’t spoken to each
                         other in a long time.</p>
                         <h3>Where was Elon musk raised?</h3>
                         <p>Musk was born and raised in South Africa, the son of a South African 
                             engineer and a Canadian mother who works as a New York City dietitian
                              and models. His father inspired his love of technology and Musk bought
                               his first computer at age 10 and taught himself how to program                               
                               by the age of 12 he sold his first commercial software, a space
                                game called Blaster.

                            After matriculating at Pretoria Boys High School he left home in 1988
                             at the age of 17, without his parents' support,
                              and in part because of the prospect of compulsory service 
                              in the South African military: "I don't have an issue with
                               serving in the military per se, but serving in the South
                                African army suppressing black people just didn't seem 
                                like a really good way to spend time."
                                 He wanted to move to the US, saying: "It is
                                  where great things are possible. I am nauseatingly pro-American."
                                   He emigrated from South Africa and traveled to Kingston, Ontario
                                    where he enrolled at Queen's University, scraping by on as 
                                    little as $1 a day
                                     with part-time and summer jobs. He then was given financial
                                      aid to attend the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
                                       "Tuition costs are outrageous ... Fortunately, they gave me a
                                        scholarship ... so I only had to cover living expenses,
                                         books, etc., by working." From Wharton he received
                                          an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed on
                                           another year to finish a second bachelor's degree
                                           
                                           in physics. His undergraduate degrees behind him, 
                                           Musk then considered three areas he wanted to get
                                            into that were "important problems," as he said later.
                                             "One was the Internet, one was clean energy, and one
                                              was space."</p>
                                              <h4>How did Elon musk become sucsesfull?</h4>
                                              <p>Elon became so successful because of his compulsivepersonality.

                                                At 11, he taught himself how to code.
                                                This required time and effort and a lot of perseverance.I think this crazy performance is
                                                 often overlooked – I tried to program (it was taught to me) and I gave up after a few days.
                                                  I’m 16.
                                                
                                                During his childhood, he read diligently and in unusual quantities.
                                                In my experience, this does not require perseverance – reading is fun
                                                and extremely rewarding, but it requires a certain way to read in most
                                                 of the waking moments of the day.
                                                
                                                When he was at university, he took up a lot of subjects – two masters
                                                 and a doctorate at Stanford.
                                                This requires hundreds of intensive and devoted hours of work.
                                                
                                                He was incontrol.
                                                While his roommate was the personification of the “party”, he remained sober. 
                                                He made his money selling tickets at the door, paid his rent, tuition fees and more
                                                 – and ultimately financed Zip2. This is often overlooked, because if he had drunk too much,
                                                  he probably wouldn’t have had the money to convince his father to invest in his first startup. 
                                                  Sobriety is the key to success…When he met his first wife, Justine, more than 8 years ago, he
                                                  
                                                  was confident and stubborn enough to continue flirting until she had gone out with him.
                                                  He asked her several times, and when she finally said yes, he forgot / he had no time to
                                                   meet her! He tried to save his relationship by taking two ice creams for the two! Without
                                                    his beautiful buddy he A) wouldn’t have been cool enough to be the legend he is now
                                                     (peoplewould have seen him as a nerd, too ambitious student – but this actually
                                                      supported the fact that he has managed to make a variety of to overcome impossibility
                                                       and thus convince investors to invest in Tesla, etc.) B) would never have had his children,
                                                        who probably contributed to his drive, and C) would not have been able to satisfy his

                                                  Musk is often reserved, but knows how to have a lot of fun.
                                                  Fun for a man like Musk requires more and more spontaneous impulsesto satisfy personalities 
                                                  like Musk.His funny life makes him the envy of many – the reason he has gained fame. He was 
                                                  first seen with Cara Delavigne, Kendall Jenner, Orlando Bloom, Zendaya, Clooney and Serena Williams.
                                                   It required a personality committed to saving humanity. For his birthday, he rented a huge 
                                                   Scottish castle, flew in his guests and had himself thrown with knives by a professional dressed
                                                    as a samurai. He built an accident with his million-dollar car, where it overturned and landed
                                                     on the roof, he laughed instead of being devastated and crying: “And best of all,I didn’t 
                                                     even have insurance!”
                                                  
                                                  He also launched Zip2 the day after arriving at Stanford because he was surprised by the
                                                   lack of innovation.
                                                  Had he been in the shadows, he would have lost all his potential. This requires confidence
                                                   and impulsiveness.
                                                  
                                                  When he worked on Zip2, he wrote code until he fell asleep.
                                                  Then he asked his colleagues to kick his beanbag when they came to the office in the

                                                  This feature is why Gates and Torvalds became so successful – they programmed in marathons to

                                                  His self-confidence drove him to invest everything he earned in his livelihood.
                                                  He bought a McLaren F1. However, this was noted as a strategic step for his later business.
                                                   In cnn’s documentary, he literally exudes self-confidence, potential, and quirks.
